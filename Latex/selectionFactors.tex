\section*{Selection of factors and levels}
We have chosen four factors that we think will be relevant to the problem. The first factor is with or without a lid, while the second is with a small pot or a large pot. Notice that the size of the cooking plate is not the same for the pot sizes. The large pot was set on a large cooking plate, while the small pot was on a small cooking plate.

The third factor was with or without a pine oil based soap, while the fourth was with or without olive oil. We were unsure of how the two last factors would affect the boiling time individually, but we had a hope that the interaction between them would be significant. As olive oil is non polar, it doesn't mix with water. It will, however, mix if the soap is added. We suspected that the olive oil would increase the boiling time because it would affect the surface tension of the water, and maybe make it harder for the water to evaporate, hence delay the boiling state.

The two last factors had a level where low was without anything, while the high level was with two spoons of the substance. Concerning the pot sizes, the small pot was low level, and large pot high level. Without lid was low level, and with lid high level.
