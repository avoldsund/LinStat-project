In table \ref{effects1} and table \ref{effects2}, you can see the main effects and the interaction effects. As one can see, the effect of $B$ is a lot larger than the other effects. This is also shown in the Pareto plot, figure \ref{fig:pareto}. If we should judge from the Pareto plot, $B$ would be the only significant effect.

From the main effects plot, figure \ref{fig:mainEff}, it is easy to see that the heating time for the low level is a lot longer than the heating time for the high level. The other three factors show a very small change when going from low to high level.

The interaction effect plot, figure \ref{fig:interaction} does not bring forth any new information. The lines are mostly parallel, except  for the interaction between $B$ and $C$.

On the analysis of influence, we used the Cook's Distance as an estimate. In our search for outliers, this test is a good indication of points that merit closer examination in our analysis. Table \ref{Cook} shows the cooks distance for the model where third and fourth-order interaction effects are assumed to be zero. An operational guideline for the D-value is that measurements where $D>1$ should be looked upon more closely. It is seen by \ref{Cook} that this is not the case for our model.

By looking at the residual plot, figure \ref{fig:residual}, a strange pattern emerges. Although it looks like the points are spread out on the y-axis, they are centered in two areas at the x-axis.

The Anderson-Darling test is a well know test for normality. For our model with third- and fourth-order interactions removed, the test resulted in a p-value of $0.2646$. Since $p > 0.05$, this p-value supports normality of the data.

We assume that the errors are normally distributed and do a QQ-plot, figure \ref{fig:qqPlot}. This shows that it is indeed normally distributed. All the measurements follow the variables, except for two points.

Because the residual plot looked a bit strange, the BoxCox-test is performed to see if y needs a transformation. But because $\lambda = 1$ is inside the 95 $\%$ confidence interval, no such transformation is required.
