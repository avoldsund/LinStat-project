Not doing the experiments in a specific order is called randomization, i.e. the run order is random. The reason for this is that potential external factors are not confounded with experimental factors. A internet site was used to generate random numbers, so the experiments were done in random order.  

We also focused on doing genuine run replicates. This means that all external factors should be equal for every experiment, at least the ones we can control. I.e. for every experiment the pot was cooled in cold water, and the lid as well. Afterwards the pots were dried. To get equal temperatures on the cooking plates, the temperature was set to maximum the entire time. In every experiment we used the same amount of water, 2.5 dL.
