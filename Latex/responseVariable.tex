In our problem we have chosen the time measured in seconds from cold water, to boiling water. The choice of response variable could, in retrospect, have been chosen better. This is because it is hard to know exactly when the boiling state occurs. Because we were two people performing the experiments, and we had slightly different standards for when it was boiling, the accuracy of the measurements was reduced.

Another possible variable could be measuring the temperature of the water, and determine the time taken to achieve that temperature. From \cite{teaTemperatures} we know that the green teas have delicate leaves, and thus the water temperature must be between $77 ^\circ$C and $85 ^\circ$C. As green teas are our cup of tea, a temperature of about $80 ^\circ$C could be a temperature where we would stop the time. This way we will not cook the leaves and ruin their delicate flavors. Apart from the olive oil and the soap, obviously, which is a minor issue. If you on the other hand have a real craving for some herbal tea, a temperature of $98 ^\circ$C will do the trick.
