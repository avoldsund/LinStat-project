\section*{Introduction}
In a world where the electric kettles are in a dominant position for heating water for your daily afternoon tea, the amount of people using cooking pots are dropping, with good reason. The superiority of the electric kettles when it comes to time usage, is well established.

If you are one of those that still use a cooking pot for heating water, we aim to give you the answers for what can be done about the problem. Don't be one of those people wasting time heating water when you instead could have taken dance lessons or learned a new language. Sure it won't be the same as electric kettles, but still, time is valuable in today's society.

Although a lot of people heat the water without a lid, it is known that it heats faster with one. We think this will indeed affect the results. Besides that we feel there are few established "myths" when it comes to what affects the time for boiling water.

In this project we want to study how different parameters affects the boiling time of water when using a cooking pot. If we can figure out the best way of boiling water efficiently, we finally have time to complete the great works of Henrik Ibsen that we have been longing to do.
