After the analysis above, some conclusions can be made regarding the boiling time of water. Both Lenth's test and reducing the model points to only one significant effect, and that is the size of the pot that was used. Some possible outliers was observed in the residual plot, but due to a Box-Cox telling us the model was acceptable, we chose to not do a transform and make the model less interpretable.

Some interactions, as the interaction between soap and oil, was surprisingly low, and maybe more surprising was the result that boiling water with lid did not have any significant effect. We did not observe any significant interactions. One thing that is interesting is that a third order interaction had the second greatest effect in the Pareto plot for the full model. One can argue that assuming third- and fourth-order interactions to be zero is not a valid assumption.
